It consists of two components: the !OpenFlow channel and !OpenFlow message codec.The !OpenFlow channel connects each switch to the controller. The !OpenFlow message codec, as its name shows, is used for encoding/decoding each time a message needs to be sent or received.\n\n\nThe core function layer contains a minimized set of functions required when deploying a controller.\nThe controller-to-Switch Message Pusher constructs new messages and push them to the !OpenFlow channel.\nFor asynchronous and symmetric messages coming from switch, the corresponding message handler will be invoked,\nwhich pre-processes the message and dispatches it to functions in northbound interface or other user defined applications outside the core space.\n\n\nThe northbound interface is the key enabler of network programmability. The presented open design enables network developers to develop applications by using two different kinds of API exposed by the controller.\nWith the local API, applications are hosted in the same machine as the controller, and use the same programming language.\nHowever, it is not always the case to keep the application and controller in the same environment.\nThus as an alternative solution, the network API provides the possibility of remote communication.\nThe controller runs an API server to handle incoming requests from other network applications.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nConvention\n\n\nCompatibility\n\n\nController-to-Switch Messaging\n\n\nMessage without Response\n\n\nMessage with Response\n\n\nEvents Delivery\n\n\nOpenFlow events\n\n\n\n\nPublish/Subscribe-like Delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nController-JSON-RPC-API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Overview\n\n\nJSON-RPC-OF is a protocol designed for communicating with the !OpenFlow controller. It defines the JSON structures for !OpenFlow Messages and a set of methods that supported by the controller to control !OpenFlow switches. The interaction procedure is based on JSON-RPC. It uses an extended version of JSON as data format.\n\n\n2 Background\n\n\nAs the leading technology of Software Defined Networking, !OpenFlow plays an important role in current network research fields. The concept of providing programmable switches makes it suitable for elastic network construction and management.\n\n\nNetwork developers are able to control the behavior of switches by using the !OpenFlow controller, which communicates with the switches using !OpenFlow protocol. In current state of the art a variety of !OpenFlow controllers developed by different organisations and institutes are available. To ease the development of user\u2019s own network applications, many of them are providing a northbound interface that consists of commonly used controller functions, which are exposed through a well-defined API. However, most existing solutions put emphasize on the local programming interface that supports only applications written in the same programming language, and hosted in the same machine as the controller. Such kind of deep language and platform coupling impedes fast integration of remote applications with the controller. Moreover, the diversity of API in different implementations also makes the interoperation between controller applications. Thus it becomes quite crucial to have a standard that unifies the controller API and enables easy exposure of the functions through the network.\n\n\nDriven by these factors, we develop the JSON-RPC-OF protocol, which is targeting standardized communication with the !OpenFlow controller and easy extension of controller functions.\n\n\n3 Convention\n\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\n\nThe data type system being used is based on JSON (RFC 4627). To ease the representation of !OpenFlow data, 5 extended types are introduced into our specification by putting restrictions on standard JSON types:\n\n\n'''hex''' - a hex number given as a JSON string, where the prefix \u201c0x\u201d is OPTIONAL\n\n\n'''enum''' - a JSON string whose value MUST be in a limit range\n\n\n'''hybrid''' - a hex or an enum\n\n\n'''bitmap''' - a JSON array that consists of enums\n\n\n'''bytearray''' - a JSON array that consists of decimal integers, with each integer between \n0, 255\n, or a hex byte string with the head being the first element of the array. When using hex representation, one byte MUST be represented by two hex digits.\n\n\nThe term \"message\" in this document, if not pointed-out specifically, refers to an !OpenFlow message defined in [\nhttps://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/openflow-spec-v1.4.0.pdf\n OpenFlow specification].\n\n\nThe term \"user\" means a user of the controller, or a remote application that needs to access controller functions.\n\n\n4 Compatibility\n\n\nThe JSON-RPC-OF is based on [\nhttps://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow/openflow-spec-v1.4.0.pdf\n OpenFlow specification 1.4]. As version 1.4 distinguish itself from previous version in many newly added/enhanced features, the data types and methods described in this document MAY not work with other OpenFlow version.\n\n\nThe JSON-RPC-OF uses JSON-RPC as the carrier protocol. All the messages exchanged SHOULD be valid JSON-RPC objects. It is not compatible with JSON-RPC 1.0. The value of \u201cjsonrpc\u201d field in every object MUST be exactly the string \u201c2.0\u201d.\n\n\n5 Controller-to-Switch Messaging\n\n\nThe controller-to-switch messages are initiated by the controller and MAY or MAY not require a response from the switch. This part introduces the pattern of methods that being used to send such kind of messages to the switch.\n\n\n5.1 Message without response\n\n\nFor sending messages that do not have corresponding reply, if the \"id\" field in a JSON-RPC request is presented, the controller SHOULD include a \"msg_id\" field in the response object. The \"msg_id\" is an identifier representing the message being sent and SHOULD be global unique to the controller. Later if the message that being sent cause an OpenFlow error in switch side, which will be reported by an asynchronous message, the controller will include the same \"msg_id\" in the error message. The generation of \"msg_id\" is outside the scope of this specification.\n\n\nExample::\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nset_config\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \ndpid\n:\n \n0xaabb000102030405\n,\n\n        \nflags\n:\n \n[\n\n            \nnormal\n,\n\n            \nreasm\n\n        \n],\n\n        \nmiss_send_len\n:\n \nno_buffer\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nresult\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nmsg_id\n:\n \n0x01020304\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Message with response\n\n\nFor sending messages that will have responses, the response object of JSON-RPC will present the response message in \"reply\" field.\n\n\nExample::\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nget_config\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \ndpid\n:\n \n0xaabb000102030405\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nresult\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nflags\n:\n \n[\n\n            \nnormal\n,\n\n            \nreasm\n\n        \n],\n\n        \nmiss_send_len\n:\n \nno_buffer\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Events Delivery\n\n\n6.1 !OpenFlow Events\n\n\n!OpenFlow events can be either switch-related or connection-related.\n\n\nThe switch-related events refer to asynchronous messages. Asynchronous messages are sent without a controller soliciting them from a switch. Switches send asynchronous messages to controllers to denote a packet arrival, switch state change or error.\n\n\nThe connection-related events report state changes in the connections between controller and switches. When a connection is established, interrupted or closed, a corresponding event will be generated.\n\n\n6.2 !Publish/Subscribe\n\n\nTo inform the users about incoming !OpenFlow events, a !Publish/Subscribe-like mechanism is introduced. The controller acts as a publisher of all kinds of events. And users are able to subscribe/unsubscribe to the events interested in and getting notifications when such events occur.\n\n\nBefore doing any subscription, the user should first register themselves to the controller. In order to be located by the controller successfully, the user/the remote application SHOULD provide a valid callback address. Later when subscribed events comes, the controller will try to publish the events by sending JSON-RPC notification to the subscriber. The format and supported protocol type of the address are outside the scope of this specification.\n\n\nAfter successful registration, the user will get a \"sub_id\" from the controller, which is the identity of the subscriber. This \"sub_id\" SHOULD also be global unique to the controller.\n\n\nThe users are able to make subscription to interested events. By making or deleting subscriptions, the \"sub_id\" obtained during registration SHOULD be present, with which the controller can identify the subscriber properly.\n\n\nWhen a user done with all his activities in controller side, a deregistration procedure will be performed to inform the controller about the leaving of this subscriber.\n\n\nThe implementation of such publish and subscribe functions are outside the scope of this specification. However, in order to show the idea more clearly, a set of Examples are presented below.\n\n\nExamples::\nIn the following example, the user provides essential informations for the server to send back notifications. Such information contains the connection type, IP address, listened port and name of the notify method.\n Registration::\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \njson-rpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nofc.sub.register\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \ntype\n:\n \nUDP\n,\n\n        \nip\n:\n \n127.0.0.1\n,\n\n        \nport\n:\n \n9999\n,\n\n        \nnotify_method\n:\n \nnotify\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nresult\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nsub_id\n:\n \n0x12345678\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nSubscription::\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nofc.sub.subscribe\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nsub_id\n:\n \n0x12345678\n,\n\n        \nsubscriptions\n:\n \n[\n\n            \n{\n\n                \ndpid\n:\n \n0xaabb000102030405\n,\n\n                \nsubscriptions\n:\n \n[\n\n                    \nChannel_Closed\n,\n\n                    \nPacket_in\n\n                \n]\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n]\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nresult\n:\n \nOK\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf\n \nlater\n \ncomes\n \na\n \npacket_in\n \nmessage,\n \nthe\n \ncontroller\n \nwill\n \ntry\n \nto\n \nconnect\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nsubscriber\n \nand\n \nsend\n \na\n \njson-rpc\n \nnotification\n \n(through\n \ntcp://\n127.0\n.\n0.1\n:\n9999\n \nin\n \nthis\n \ncase)\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nnotify\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \ntype\n:\n \nPacket_In\n,\n\n        \ndpid\n:\n \n0xaabb000102030405\n,\n\n        \nxid\n:\n \n0x01020304\n,\n\n        \nbuffer_id\n:\n \nno_buffer\n,\n\n        \nreason\n:\n \nno_match\n,\n\n        \ntable_id\n:\n \n0x01\n,\n\n        \ncookie\n:\n \n0x0102030405060708\n,\n\n        \nofp_match\n:\n \n[\n\n            \n{\n\n                \nclass\n:\n \nofb\n,\n\n                \nfield\n:\n \nin_port\n,\n\n                \nvalue\n:\n \n0x05\n\n            \n},\n\n            \n{\n\n                \nclass\n:\n \nofb\n,\n\n                \nfield\n:\n \nin_phy_port\n,\n\n                \nvalue\n:\n \n0x01\n\n            \n},\n\n            \n{\n\n                \nclass\n:\n \nofb\n,\n\n                \nfield\n:\n \narp_op\n,\n\n                \nvalue\n:\n \n0x01\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n],\n\n        \ndata\n:\n \n0xffffffffffff00\n\n\n                 1ff344e539080600\n\n\n                 0108000604000100\n\n\n                 1ff344e5390a9341\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe::\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nofc.sub.unsubscribe\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nsub_id\n:\n \n0x12345678\n,\n\n        \nsubscriptions\n:\n \n[\n\n            \n{\n\n                \ndpid\n:\n \n0xaabb000102030405\n,\n\n                \nsubscriptions\n:\n \n[\n\n                    \nChannel_Closed\n,\n\n                    \nPacket_in\n\n                \n]\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n]\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nresult\n:\n \nOK\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nDeregistration::\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nmethod\n:\n \nofc.sub.deregister\n,\n\n    \nparams\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nsub_id\n:\n \n0x12345678\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n--\n\n\n{\n\n    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n    \njsonrpc\n:\n \n2.0\n,\n\n    \nresult\n:\n \nOK\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n7 Extensions\n\n\nThe controller developers are able to develop their own extensions for the JSON-RPC-OF protocol by introducing new methods, only if such methods meet the requirements of standard JSON-RPC 2.0, and not violating the rules defined in this specification.

It consists of two components: the !OpenFlow channel and !OpenFlow message codec.The !OpenFlow channel connects each switch to the controller. The !OpenFlow message codec, as its name shows, is used for encoding/decoding each time a message needs to be sent or received.  The core function layer contains a minimized set of functions required when deploying a controller.\nThe controller-to-Switch Message Pusher constructs new messages and push them to the !OpenFlow channel.\nFor asynchronous and symmetric messages coming from switch, the corresponding message handler will be invoked,\nwhich pre-processes the message and dispatches it to functions in northbound interface or other user defined applications outside the core space.  The northbound interface is the key enabler of network programmability. The presented open design enables network developers to develop applications by using two different kinds of API exposed by the controller.\nWith the local API, applications are hosted in the same machine as the controller, and use the same programming language.\nHowever, it is not always the case to keep the application and controller in the same environment.\nThus as an alternative solution, the network API provides the possibility of remote communication.\nThe controller runs an API server to handle incoming requests from other network applications.",

            "text": "As the leading technology of Software Defined Networking, !OpenFlow plays an important role in current network research fields. The concept of providing programmable switches makes it suitable for elastic network construction and management.  Network developers are able to control the behavior of switches by using the !OpenFlow controller, which communicates with the switches using !OpenFlow protocol. In current state of the art a variety of !OpenFlow controllers developed by different organisations and institutes are available. To ease the development of user\u2019s own network applications, many of them are providing a northbound interface that consists of commonly used controller functions, which are exposed through a well-defined API. However, most existing solutions put emphasize on the local programming interface that supports only applications written in the same programming language, and hosted in the same machine as the controller. Such kind of deep language and platform coupling impedes fast integration of remote applications with the controller. Moreover, the diversity of API in different implementations also makes the interoperation between controller applications. Thus it becomes quite crucial to have a standard that unifies the controller API and enables easy exposure of the functions through the network.  Driven by these factors, we develop the JSON-RPC-OF protocol, which is targeting standardized communication with the !OpenFlow controller and easy extension of controller functions.",

And users are able to subscribe/unsubscribe to the events interested in and getting notifications when such events occur.  Before doing any subscription, the user should first register themselves to the controller. In order to be located by the controller successfully, the user/the remote application SHOULD provide a valid callback address. Later when subscribed events comes, the controller will try to publish the events by sending JSON-RPC notification to the subscriber. The format and supported protocol type of the address are outside the scope of this specification.  After successful registration, the user will get a \"sub_id\" from the controller, which is the identity of the subscriber. This \"sub_id\" SHOULD also be global unique to the controller.  The users are able to make subscription to interested events. By making or deleting subscriptions, the \"sub_id\" obtained during registration SHOULD be present, with which the controller can identify the subscriber properly.  When a user done with all his activities in controller side, a deregistration procedure will be performed to inform the controller about the leaving of this subscriber.  The implementation of such publish and subscribe functions are outside the scope of this specification. However, in order to show the idea more clearly, a set of Examples are presented below.

[1]\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nAs described in \nSDN Manager documentation\n, after successful instantiation of the resources, the experimenter receives the URI of the proxied OpenDaylight controller, a token and the list of tables assigned to him.\n\n\nWhen the experiment starts, for every OpenFlow node, all the flows of table 0 are redirected to the first table assigned to the user and then go to table 17.\n\n\n\n\nThen, the experimenter can make JSON Restconf requests to the proxied SDN controller. Every request must contain in the header the token received, and the experimenter can create/edit/delete flows only in the tables assigned to him.\n\n\nThe created flows can forward packets only to other experimenter owned tables or to the table 17.\n\n\nAs action, in the attribute \n\"output-node-connector\"\n are \nallowed\n only the values \n\"TABLE\"\n and \n\"IN_PORT\"\n, or a \nport_id\n\nThe values \n\"ALL\"\n, \n\"CONTROLLER\"\n, \n\"ANY\"\n, \n\"LOCAL\"\n, \n\"NORMAL\"\n, \n\"FLOOD\"\n are \nnot allowed\n.\n\n\nFor further information about these values, you can read the \nofficial Openflow documentation\n\n\nAll the requests that not satisfy the above requirements, will be rejected with an http status code = 403\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can call Restconf services as described in the \nOpenDaylight official documentation\n, but you can't use xml format and have to add the header \n'API-Token'\n. No Basic Authentication header is needed.\n\n\n\n\nHere below some examples of Restconf requests:\n\n\nREST get nodes example:\n\n\n\n\nHeaders:\n\n\nContent-type: application/json\n\n\nAccept: application/json\n\n\nAPI-Token: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nURL:\n    http://[HSOTNAME]:[PORT]/restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/\n\n\nMethod: GET\n\n\n\n\nRequest body: EMPTY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse body:\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nnodes\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nnode\n:\n \n[\n\n                \n{\n\n                    \nid\n:\n \nopenflow:257478269489732\n,\n\n                    \nnode-connector\n:\n \n[\n\n                        \n{\n\n                            \nid\n:\n \nopenflow:257478269489732:4\n,\n\n                            \n...\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:name\n:\n \ntapfa76a4ad-58\n,\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:configuration\n:\n \nPORT-UP\n,\n\n                            \naddress-tracker:addresses\n:\n \n[\n\n                                \n{\n\n                                    \nid\n:\n \n0\n,\n\n                                    \nip\n:\n \n10.0.0.10\n,\n\n                                    \nmac\n:\n \nfa:16:3e:a9:9e:39\n,\n\n                                    \nfirst-seen\n:\n \n1497436298506\n,\n\n                                    \nlast-seen\n:\n \n1497436298506\n\n                                \n}\n\n                            \n]\n\n                        \n},\n\n                        \n{\n\n                            \nid\n:\n \nopenflow:257478269489732:2\n,\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:name\n:\n \ntap40c62f4c-f7\n,\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:configuration\n:\n \nPORT-DOWN\n,\n\n                            \naddress-tracker:addresses\n:\n \n[\n\n                                \n{\n\n                                    \nid\n:\n \n2\n,\n\n                                    \nip\n:\n \n10.0.0.2\n,\n\n                                    \nmac\n:\n \nfa:16:3e:0d:c6:40\n,\n\n                                    \nfirst-seen\n:\n \n1497436298793\n,\n\n                                    \nlast-seen\n:\n \n1497448932221\n\n                                \n}\n\n                            \n]\n\n                        \n},\n\n                        \n{\n\n                            \nid\n:\n \nopenflow:257478269489732:1\n,\n\n                            \n...\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:name\n:\n \ntapd0bff1a4-2d\n,\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:configuration\n:\n \nPORT-DOWN\n,\n\n                            \naddress-tracker:addresses\n:\n \n[\n\n                                \n{\n\n                                    \nid\n:\n \n1\n,\n\n                                    \nip\n:\n \n10.0.0.2\n,\n\n                                    \nmac\n:\n \nfa:16:3e:60:fd:aa\n,\n\n                                    \nfirst-seen\n:\n \n1497436298646\n,\n\n                                    \nlast-seen\n:\n \n1497448932220\n\n                                \n}\n\n                            \n]\n\n                        \n},\n\n                        \n{\n\n                            \nid\n:\n \nopenflow:257478269489732:7\n,\n\n                            \n...\n\n                            \nflow-node-inventory:name\n:\n \ntap62ce8677-d8\n,\n\n                            \naddress-tracker:addresses\n:\n \n[\n\n                                \n{\n\n                                    \nid\n:\n \n3\n,\n\n                                    \nip\n:\n \n10.0.0.3\n,\n\n                                    \nmac\n:\n \nfa:16:3e:93:ff:b6\n,\n\n                                    \nfirst-seen\n:\n \n1497448932261\n,\n\n                                    \nlast-seen\n:\n \n1497448932261\n\n                                \n}\n\n                            \n]\n\n                        \n}\n\n                        \n...\n\n                    \n]\n\n                \n}\n\n            \n]\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREST put flow example -

They can access and configure it through a static initial configuration, included in the\nTOSCA description of the Experiment, or, once deployed, through the interfaces that expose its\nmain services. These interfaces can include SSH, a dashboard, or ReST APIs.\nDepending on the type of Resource, Experimenters can also ask the Security Resource to send its log messages to a remote log\ncollector, which makes them available in a simple web page reserved to them. The Experimenters\ncould easily access it through its web browser and check the behaviour of all their security agents,\nand to see some related statistics.\n\n\nThe Experimenters can get the Security Resource in two different formats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an agent directly installed in the VM that they want to monitor. The system will\nprovide them a script that the Experimenters have just to run inside the VM. It will be already\nconfigured as required in the TOSCA description of the resource. The output of the script\nwill provide to the Experimenters information on how to access the deployed resource\n(URLs, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a standalone VM. The Security Resource will be deployed directly by the Security\nManager in the testbed chosen by the Experimenter. The Security Manager will take\ncare of the initial configuration of the resource.\nThe Experimenters have to set up on their own the redirection of the network traffic that they want\nto control through the Security Resource VM (by means of OS configuration, or SDN capabilities provided by the SoftFIRE platform).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Security Manager provides three types of resources:\n\n\n\n\nfirewall\n\n\nsuricata\n\n\npfsense\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Resource definition\n\n\nIn this section the attributes that can be defined for a TOSCA node of type \nSecurityResource\n are listed.

These interfaces can include SSH, a dashboard, or ReST APIs.\nDepending on the type of Resource, Experimenters can also ask the Security Resource to send its log messages to a remote log\ncollector, which makes them available in a simple web page reserved to them. The Experimenters\ncould easily access it through its web browser and check the behaviour of all their security agents,\nand to see some related statistics.  The Experimenters can get the Security Resource in two different formats:    As an agent directly installed in the VM that they want to monitor. The system will\nprovide them a script that the Experimenters have just to run inside the VM. It will be already\nconfigured as required in the TOSCA description of the resource. The output of the script\nwill provide to the Experimenters information on how to access the deployed resource\n(URLs, etc.)    As a standalone VM. The Security Resource will be deployed directly by the Security\nManager in the testbed chosen by the Experimenter. The Security Manager will take\ncare of the initial configuration of the resource.\nThe Experimenters have to set up on their own the redirection of the network traffic that they want\nto control through the Security Resource VM (by means of OS configuration, or SDN capabilities provided by the SoftFIRE platform).

RULE SYNTAX  Users can specify rules using either a simple syntax or a full syntax.\nThe simple syntax only specifies the port and optionally the protocol to\nbe allowed or denied on the host.  Example rules using the simple syntax:  allow 53  This rule will allow tcp and udp port 53 to any address on the firewall\nhost. To specify a protocol, append  /protocol  to the port.  Users can also use a fuller syntax, specifying the source and\ndestination addresses and ports. This syntax is loosely based on\nOpenBSD\u2019s PF syntax. For example:  deny proto tcp to any port 80  This will deny all traffic to tcp port 80.  deny proto tcp from 10.0.0.0/8 to 192.168.0.1 port 25  This will deny all traffic from the RFC1918 Class A network to tcp port\n25 with the address 192.168.0.1.",

In our NSD you can see e.g. that the \nubuntuclient\n VNFD runs a script called \ninstall.sh\n in its \nINSTANTIATE\n lifecycle.\n\nFurthermore VNFDs may have configuration parameters which are passed as key value pairs and are available in the scripts and an endpoint, which specifies the type of VNFM with which the VNFD shall be used.\n\nEach VNFD contains at least one Virtual Deployment Unit (VDU). With the help of VDUs it is possible to deploy a VNFD on different testbeds and to specify the maximum number of VNF instances which can be created by scaling out.\nIn our example the ubuntuclient only has one VDU, i.e. VDU1.\n\nAnother important part of the NSD file are the relationships between VNFDs defined in the \nrelationships_template:\n section.\nHere you can specify dependencies which exist between VNFDs, e.g. if the client needs the IP address of the server.\n\n\nUntil now we only have the structure of our Network Service which consists of two VNFDs which themselves contain one VDU each.\nBut what about the functionality of the VNFDs? This is defined in the lifecycle scripts.\nAs we saw the VNFDs can have scripts which are executed in their different lifecycles.\nThe scripts are stored in the \nScripts\n folder.\nLet\\'s create them.\n\n\nmkdir -p Scripts/ubuntuserver\nmkdir -p Scripts/ubuntuclient\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuserver/ubuntuclient_relation.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuserver/start.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuserver/install.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuclient/ubuntuserver_relation.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuclient/start.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuclient/install.sh\n\n\n\n\nThe subfolder names correspond to the VNFD types in the \nDefinitions/ubuntu.yaml\n file.\n\n\nHere are the contents of the script files:\n\n\nScripts/ubuntuserver/install.sh\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n\necho\n \ninstalling!!!\n\n\necho\n \nAvoid long outputs! so redirect the output to a file that you can later check, for instance:\n\nsudo apt-get update \n /tmp/install.log\n\necho\n \napt update worked!\n\nsudo apt-get install -y cowsay \n /tmp/install.log\n\n\necho\n \ncheck the env before running special commands\n\nenv\n\necho\n \nlike this one...\n\n/usr/games/cowsay -f tux \ninstall successfull\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first script executed on the server.

Now we can archive everything as a csar archive.\n\n\nzip -r clean-ubuntu.csar . -x \n.*\n -x \n*/.*\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the archive is created you can delete the files and directories if you want to.\n\n\nThe last step is to compress also the complete experiment to a csar file.\n\n\ncd\n ..\nzip -r my-experiment.csar . -x \n.*\n -x \n*/.*\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIn this tutorial we created an experiment with a custom Nfv resources.\nFor this we created an experiment as usual, but instead of referencing a resource_id which is already provided by SoftFIRE, we used our own.\nThen we created a NSD written in TOSCA and built a csar archive for it.\nWe placed the archive in the experiments \nFiles\n folder and compressed the whole experiment into a csar archive.\n\nFor uploading and running the experiment you can refer to the \nIperf tutorial\n as the procedure is the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      // Creating custom :external selector\n      $.expr[':'].external = function(obj){\n          return !obj.href.match(/^mailto\\:/)\n                  && (obj.hostname != location.hostname);\n      };\n      $(function(){\n        $('a:external').addClass('external');\n        $(\".external\").attr('target','_blank');\n      })",

In our NSD you can see e.g. that the  ubuntuclient  VNFD runs a script called  install.sh  in its  INSTANTIATE  lifecycle. \nFurthermore VNFDs may have configuration parameters which are passed as key value pairs and are available in the scripts and an endpoint, which specifies the type of VNFM with which the VNFD shall be used. \nEach VNFD contains at least one Virtual Deployment Unit (VDU). With the help of VDUs it is possible to deploy a VNFD on different testbeds and to specify the maximum number of VNF instances which can be created by scaling out.\nIn our example the ubuntuclient only has one VDU, i.e. VDU1. \nAnother important part of the NSD file are the relationships between VNFDs defined in the  relationships_template:  section.\nHere you can specify dependencies which exist between VNFDs, e.g. if the client needs the IP address of the server.  Until now we only have the structure of our Network Service which consists of two VNFDs which themselves contain one VDU each.\nBut what about the functionality of the VNFDs? This is defined in the lifecycle scripts.\nAs we saw the VNFDs can have scripts which are executed in their different lifecycles.\nThe scripts are stored in the  Scripts  folder.\nLet\\'s create them.  mkdir -p Scripts/ubuntuserver\nmkdir -p Scripts/ubuntuclient\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuserver/ubuntuclient_relation.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuserver/start.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuserver/install.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuclient/ubuntuserver_relation.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuclient/start.sh\ntouch Scripts/ubuntuclient/install.sh  The subfolder names correspond to the VNFD types in the  Definitions/ubuntu.yaml  file.

Also adding the floating ip and the name parameters is a must, as the zabbix_agent_configuration script will be based on them.\n\n\nFor this solution, Ubuntu-14.04 image should be used for the zabbix-server VNF that can be configured in the nsd yaml in the VDU part by adding the artifacts parameter including the image file required as shown in the example below.

For all other VNFs who will need to be monitored, a lifecycle event  CONFIGURE  script (zabbix_configure_agent.sh) should be added to install and configure zabbix agent as shown in example below for the iperf-client:       iperf-client : \n       type :   openbaton.type.VNF \n       properties : \n         ID :   client-vnf \n         vendor :   FOKUS \n         version :   1.0 \n         type :   client \n         deploymentFlavour : \n           -   flavour_key :   m1.small \n\n         endpoint :   generic \n       requirements : \n          -   virtualLink :   Server-Network \n          -   vdu :   VDU1 \n       interfaces : \n           lifecycle :   # lifecycle \n             INSTANTIATE : \n               -   install.sh \n             CONFIGURE : \n               -   zabbix_configure_agent.sh   The same as above should be configured for iperf-server.  In the nsd yaml, the relation dependency should be provided to let zabbix server be ready first then configure the zabbix agent in the monitored VNFs as the example shown below:  relationships_template : \n   rel1 :  \n     type :   tosca.nodes.relationships.ConnectsTo \n     source :   zabbixserver \n     target :   iperf-client \n     parameters : \n         -   softfire-internal_floatingIp \n         -   name  \nThe above relationship should be replicated with all other VNFs (iperf-server VNF in this example) that you need to monitor.  For the relation dependency, the zabbixserver should be the source and other VNFs should be the target. Also adding the floating ip and the name parameters is a must, as the zabbix_agent_configuration script will be based on them.  For this solution, Ubuntu-14.04 image should be used for the zabbix-server VNF that can be configured in the nsd yaml in the VDU part by adding the artifacts parameter including the image file required as shown in the example below. This way will add more flexibility in using different images per VNFs.
